# Dodge-the-Creeps: 
Week 2 game dev project

From tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html 

- Time to complete base tutorial: **~2 hours**

### Change 1: Pause
- Time to complete: **~1 hour**

Attempted to use AI for getting started, code was incorrect, but it did lead me to the official documentation for pausing in Godot

### Change 2: Settings Menu with Master Audio
- Time to complete: **~1 hour**

Attempted to just figure it out in the engine, did some wonky coding and weird signals, looked up the video linked below and was able to set it up. I also added some buttons to get to a settings menu along with some shortcuts.

### Change 3: Slow down power up -> increased score
- Time to complete: **~1 hour**

Took me way to long, did the wrong things at first, there is some code that needs cleaning, but now it works.
